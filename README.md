# Workshop_3
This project provides the backend and frontend of a vehicle constructor company. These are developed using _design pattens_ and _Python_ language.

## Requirements
- Application is still consuming a lot of memory, so you must reduce ir as much as possible.
- An authentication system is needed, so you must create a simple login system where you could register users and authenticate.
- You should differentiate two types of users: _Admin_ and _User_. Admins could create, update, and delete vehicles, while Users could only see and search the vehicles. 
- You should log all the actions made by the users, so you could track both the changes made in the vehicles and searches performed.
- Separate your project in different subsystems, and made a simple interface to interact with them.
- In addition, you must create a monitoring system to check the memory consumption and time execution of the searches in the application, and save stats in _a performance-log_ file.
- To increase performance, you should implement a cache system to store the last five search results over vehicles. 
- Verify if you could add encapsulation to increase the security of the application.
